All runnable code is on restart branch of this repository!

**Got 64% in the tests: 

* I couldn't figure out how to get the HELO base message to get sent fully back, all the client got back was the letter H from my response which was wierd I thought (again works when I run on my computer!)
* Test suite wanted to be sent back a chat message that a client has left a room when they disconnected, mine disconnects and clients are removed from their respective chatrooms
